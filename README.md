# File Converter

I created this for my dad so that he could sort through a maintenance log that he stores in an SQLite database. 

I wrote out the requirements and got to work. 

I used [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), Python's built-in SQLite libraryi, and [openpyxl](https://openpyxl.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) in order to open the SQLite database, sort through it, and export it in an excel format.
